I'm particularly proud of code I developed across two significant professional roles:

In my previous position, I implemented a comprehensive product update history tracking system using PostgreSQL, JavaScript, and React. This system enabled efficient product lifecycle monitoring by:

1. Creating a robust database schema with temporal tables in PostgreSQL to track all product state changes
2. Developing a Node.js middleware layer that processed and validated update events
3. Building a React-based visualization component that presented chronological product history with filtering capabilities

The code significantly improved decision-making for both operations and sales teams by providing transparent visibility into product evolution. The system allowed stakeholders to understand exactly when and how products changed over time, enhancing collaboration between departments.

In my current role working on a World Bank-Daldberg project, I've engineered high-performance backend systems using TypeScript, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Redis. I'm particularly proud of:

1. The scalable architecture that handles variable load conditions
2. The security implementation featuring JWT authentication, role-based access control, and data encryption
3. The caching layer using Redis that dramatically improved response times for frequently accessed data

This backend foundation supports critical functionality while maintaining excellent performance even as the system scales with increasing users and data volume.
